#Script that identifies sequences of activity from, in this case, a fed in ground truth, to then identify sequences and calculate
#Sole purpose of protocol is to define order of presentations

#Now: Write from scratch, goal is to take sequences and average values for the second pres in the sequence
#Export is CSV where mouse protocol names are on the columns, transition type on the rows, and values are the averaged data
#Input is behavior files? I suppose that would work
